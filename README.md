# mobile-price-classification
Exploratory data analysis of the Kaggle “Mobile Price Classification” dataset with an automated Jupyter report (correlations, distributions, feature insights). EDA-focused, no modeling.

A short exploratory Jupyter project for the Mobile Price Classification dataset. The goal is to understand relationships between device features and price_range (price segment): quick EDA, data tidying, correlations, and clear visualizations. The project does not include model training (EDA-focused).
